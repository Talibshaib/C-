// C++ is a powerful programming language that is widely used for developing a variety of applications.
// It is an extension of the C programming language with added features like classes and objects, which support object-oriented programming.

// Key features of C++ include:
// 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): C++ supports the concepts of classes and objects, allowing you to create reusable code and organize your program's structure.
// 2. Strong Typing: C++ enforces strong typing, which means that variables must be declared with their specific data types before they can be used.
// 3. Standard Template Library (STL): C++ provides a rich set of libraries, including containers, algorithms, and iterators, which can greatly simplify development tasks.
// 4. Memory Management: C++ gives you control over memory management through features like dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using the 'new' and 'delete' operators.
// 5. Performance: C++ is known for its efficiency and performance, making it a popular choice for applications that require high performance, such as game development and system programming.

// Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in C++:
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

// In this program, we include the <iostream> header file, which provides input/output stream functionality.
// The 'main' function is the entry point of the program, where the execution starts.
// Inside the 'main' function, we use the 'std::cout' object to print the message "Hello, World!" to the console.
// The 'std::endl' is used to insert a new line after the message.
// Finally, we return 0 to indicate successful program execution.
